Navigating the academic Swedish software engineering landscape can be difficult. Swe-SE-SCI lists all Swedish Software Engineering (SE) scholars with permanent positions at Swedish non-profit research organizations. The ambition is to maintain an index of all Swedish SE scholars with first-authored publications in SCI-listed SE journals, i.e., "SSS scholars". Swe-SE-SCI mines DBLP publication lists to identify typical research topics of Swedish SE research organizations and apparent research interests of SSS scholars.

A reliable and updated index of academic SE in Sweden could bring several benefits. The primary goal is to constitute a gateway for industry to find expertise among researchers – hopefully supporting knowledge transfer, industry-academia collaboration, and more relevant research. Swe-SE-SCI can also be used to find academic partners in new research projects and suitable PhD committee members.

Affiliations are ranked by the number of first-authored SCI publications by SSS scholars. Individual SSS scholars are ranked by their SSS rating – our in-house metric. In contrast to non-decreasing citation-based metrics, the SSS rating fluctuates as it promotes active research with a focus to publish in SCI-listed SE journals.
